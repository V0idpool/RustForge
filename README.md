RustForge takes any image, automatically converts it to the closest Rust color palette, and paints it directly onto a sign in-game. It‚Äôs perfect for adding custom, high-quality art to your base without spending hours on it.

## Premium Access

Premium unlocks advanced features, helps fund ongoing development, and gives you early access to new tools before the general public.

**üíé How to get Premium**: Donate ANY amount via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/rustforgedev), and you‚Äôll receive Premium access as a thank-you.

### Premium Features

* **VoidWeave Algorithm** ‚Äì The most advanced painting method for stunning, detailed, high-fidelity images. Scans the image, and blends pixels as it paints.

* **Resume Painting on Click**: Press the Resume On Click Hotkey: **F5** and click a point on the canvas with your image loaded, and the paint session will resume from that row with the correct palette color. No more redoing entire paintings if you die, disconnect, or crash mid-paint.

* **Session Save** ‚Äì Save your painting progress and resume later without restarting. This is useful if you need to reboot, or something happens where you need to close the game or step away for extended periods.

* **Session Load** ‚Äì Quickly load a saved session and continue painting exactly where you left off.

## Features

* **Load Recent Files**: Don't waste time searching for images! A new menu item now saves the last 10 used images, allowing you to quickly load them without having to re-select from your computer or enter a URL.

* **Real-time Notifications**: Stay informed about your painting status with new toast notifications that appear in the top-right corner of the screen. You will now be notified when a paint session starts, pauses, or stops.

### Multiple Painting Methods
Choose from several methods to transfer your image to the canvas, each with a unique style:

* **VoidWeave Algorithm(Premium)**: The default and most advanced method. It's designed for complex, detailed images and provides the most accurate color representation and highest quality final image.
* **Scanline**: A methodical, line-by-line painting method.
* **Crayon Eater**: A distinct painting style that adds character to your final image.

### Image Filters
Prepare your images with a variety of built-in filters to enhance them before painting.

* **None**: Applies no artistic filter, using the original image as a base.
* **Comic Filter**: A specialized filter for a cartoon-like appearance.
* **Oil Paint**: Applies a painterly effect, simulating an oil painting.
* **Pixel Art / Mosaic**: Converts your image into a simplified mosaic of larger, distinct pixels, giving it a pixelated look.
* **Charcoal Sketch**: Transforms the image into a black and white sketch, mimicking a charcoal drawing.
* **Dithering**: Reduces the number of colors in the image while creating the illusion of more colors by scattering pixels.
* **Sepia Tone**: Applies a reddish-brown tint to the image, giving it an antique, vintage look.
* **Emboss**: Adds a raised, three-dimensional effect to your image.
* **Watercolor**: Smooth, painterly effect with soft edges, simulating watercolor painting.

### Smoothing & Sharpening Filters
Fine-tune your image with smoothing filters to adjust its clarity and smoothness. Options include:

* **None**: Applies no smoothing or sharpening.
* **Gaussian**: Blurs the image to reduce noise and detail, creating a smooth, soft effect. Available sizes include: `3x3`, `5x5`, `7x7`.
* **Median**: A non-linear digital filter that is particularly effective at removing "salt and pepper" noise from images while preserving edges. Available sizes include: `3x3`, `5x5`, `7x7`, `9x9`.
* **Mean**: A simple averaging filter that smooths an image by replacing each pixel with the average value of its neighbors. Available sizes include: `3x3`, `5x5`.
* **LowPass**: A filter that smooths an image by reducing high-frequency details (like noise and sharp edges). Available sizes include: `3x3`, `5x5`.
* **Sharpen**: Enhances the edges of an image, making it appear sharper and more defined. The available size is: `3x3`.

### Configurable Hotkeys
Customize hotkeys for key actions directly from the user settings window, including starting, pausing, and stopping the painting process.

### Accurate Painting Time Estimation
A dedicated form that displays an accurate estimated painting time before it even begins.

## How to Use

1.  **Load an Image**: Use the main RustForge window to load the image you wish to paint by clicking "Load Image...".
2.  **Capture Your Regions**:
    * **Palette**: Use the hotkey for "Capture Palette" to draw a box around the in-game color palette. This allows the application to sample the available colors. (ONLY CAPTURE THE COLOR PALETTE AREA)
    * **Canvas**: Use the hotkey for "Capture Canvas" to draw a box around the in-game canvas. This defines the area where the painting will take place.
3.  **Configure Settings**: In the settings window, you can select your preferred paint method, apply various filters, and adjust the paint speed.
4.  **Start Painting**: Once the image is processed and regions are defined, press the "Start" hotkey to begin the painting process.
5.  **Pause and Stop**: Use the assigned hotkeys to pause or stop the painting process at any time.
